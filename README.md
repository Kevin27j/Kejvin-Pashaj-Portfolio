## Description

I have made this portfolio to record my projects and to share them with the world and other developers. Feedbacks and thoughts are more than welcome!

On my projects section I have left placeholders instead of actual links. Currently I am in the process of learning Web Development and I will update with new projects as I create them.

I hope you enjoy!üòÅ
